- 👋 Hi, I’m Blaize!
- 👀 I’m interested in oriental culture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to learn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on international endeavours. 
- 📫 How to reach me? How to reach anyone? Is anything we say even remotely worth the effort? Do people care about anyone other than themselves? If so, why do we give such importance to things such as self-image? Why yearn to improve ourselves, when everyone is too preoccupied to give a damn? The answer of course, is cheese.
